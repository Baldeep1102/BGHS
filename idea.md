Simple project:

We as a group are reading Bhagavad gita commentary written by Pujya Swami Dayananda Saraswati ji. We read few pages for 1.5 hrs on a weekly basis. Now time by time as we go through the text and hit certain milestones on modules that we've read, we want a concise bullet point summary of the text read so far to be made available to us. This summary SHOULD be from the text read and NOT from anywhere else.

I need to create an interface where I upload the PDF of book or books that are being read and the output should be a semantic summary of the major sections (not the subsections). So section name A - summary A, section name B - summary B etc.

The summary should have a copy option so that a formatted copy of that can be shard witn people who've read it

A simple page that is responsive on mobile, and has the upload option is whats required. I will share the pic of Pujya swamiji as well so make it feel like a spiritual page with his pic as well. OR i will also share the pics of the the study books volumes, so that you can have them in the UI as well



For you to get an idea, have left the first volume pdf book in this folder only.. You can read this and check what i mean by important sections. Feg in first book (ie volume 1), Introduction, Gita Dhyanam, Context of Gita and Chapter 1 are the main sections that require summary.
